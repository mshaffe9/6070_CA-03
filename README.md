# 6070_CA-03

CA-03

The purpose of this assignment is to train a decision tree model to predict the income class of an individual. I was given a dataset obtained from Census Bureau and did my best to understand the data, perform a Data Quality Analysis, build a Decision Tree Classifier Model, evaluated Decision Tree performance, tuned the Decision Tree performance, visualized my best decision tree, noted some observations about my model, and predicted an individual's income class with my "trained" Decision Model.

To view this assignment, download the 6070_CA_03 (1).ipynb file and upload it to JupyterLab or GoogleColab. To upload the file, go to the file icon on either JupyterLab or GoogleColab and press the Upload arrow icon. Select the 6070_CA_01.ipynb file that you had previously downloaded and upload it. If on GoogleColab, go to the File tab to the right of the CO orange symbol, go to Open Notebook, go to Upload, and select the 6070_CA_03 (1).ipynb file. If on JupyterLab, double click that file and see it pop up. Click either Run or Runtime and Run All Cells to run all of the code. Scroll from top to bottom to see my Decision Tree process. I have embetted headings, comments, explanations, and observations within the code so that it is more easily understood to the viewer.
